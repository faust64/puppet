!WARNING!

I don't see a way to properly deploy a bluemind from scratch
- especially due to a few user inputs while running bm setup script
Moreover, the administration interface allowing you to customize various
settings related to postfix, nginx, cyrus or java: I would avoid overriding
any of these with my modules.
Thus, this module assumes you've already installed and configured bm on
your system (in my case, 3.5.2). We would stick to monitoring/supervision
and logs management.
