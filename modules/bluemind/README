!WARNING!

I don't see a way to properly deploy a bluemind from scratch - especially
due to a few user inputs while running bm setup script. Moreover, the
administration interface allowing you to customize various settings related
to postfix, nginx, cyrus or java: I would avoid overriding any of these with
my modules.
Thus, this module assumes you've already installed and configured bm on
your system (in my case, 4.2.7). We would stick to monitoring/supervision
and logs management.

For the record, this module would read postfix virtual alias/mailbox maps,
to duplicate them on all other public SMTPs. Once synced those relays may
start refusing messages for addresses that do not exist on the new instance.
Before first applying puppet, it would be recommended to ensure LDAP import
was properly configured, a first global sync did succeed, and all shared
mailboxes were re-created (ansible, freebsd, frnog, openbsd, ...) including
their aliases, main domain aliases (abuse, info, contact, root, ...) were
added to bluemind admin mailbox, and domain aliases were set (intra.xxx,
vms.intra.xxx, ...).

Eventually, edit the "all" group synced from LDAP, grant it with privileges
accessing mails, contacts, calendars, activesync, outlook/thunderbird plugins,
view domain filters, manage their own filters, identities, ...
