FYI: deploying a new server, note that class would not initialize Racktables.
Having first applied this module, remove the /var/www/racktables/inc/secret.php
file and disable LDAP authentication on your webserver.

Connect to Racktables UI, initialize installation.
In Racktables settings, Permissions tab, keep the first line unchanged and allow
your LDAP user connecting in (eg, with username = faust)

```
allow {$userid_1}
allow {$username_faust}
```

Now, we may apply puppet again, which would reinitialize Racktables secret.php
and Apache configuration. You may then operate Racktables authenticating with
your LDAP account.
